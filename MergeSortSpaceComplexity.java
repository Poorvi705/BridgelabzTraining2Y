/*1. Explanation of Merge Sort Extra Memory

Merge Sort divides the array into smaller subarrays and then merges them in sorted order. During merging, a temporary array is required to store the sorted elements before copying them back into the original array. For an input array of size n, this temporary array can require n extra spaces.

Therefore, the auxiliary space complexity of Merge Sort is O(n).
2. Comparison with In-Place Sorting Algorithms

Merge Sort requires O(n) extra memory because of the temporary array used during merging.

In comparison, Insertion Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm and requires only O(1) auxiliary space. Quick Sort is also generally performed in-place and requires O(log n) auxiliary space on average due to recursive function calls.

Therefore, in terms of space efficiency:

Insertion Sort O(1) > Quick Sort O(log n) > Merge Sort O(n)

Hence, Merge Sort is less space-efficient than Insertion Sort and typical in-place Quick Sort.

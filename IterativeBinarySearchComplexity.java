/*Problem TC-2: Iterative Binary Search Complexity
 1. Step-by-step search range narrowing for target = 4:
 Sorted Array: {0, 2, 3, 4, 8, 61}
 Step 1:
 low = 0, high = 5
 mid = (0 + 5) / 2 = 2
 arr[2] = 3
 Since 3 < 4, search in the right half.
 low = mid + 1 = 3
 Step 2:
 low = 3, high = 5
 mid = (3 + 5) / 2 = 4
 arr[4] = 8
 Since 8 > 4, search in the left half.
 high = mid - 1 = 3
Step 3:
 low = 3, high = 3
 mid = (3 + 3) / 2 = 3
 arr[3] = 4
 Target 4 is found at index 3.
 2. Worst Case Time Complexity:
Binary Search divides the search space into half after every iteration: N -> N/2 -> N/4 -> N/8 -> ... -> N/(2^k)
 In the worst case, the search continues until only one element remains:
 N / (2^k) = 1
Therefore:
 N = 2^k
 k = log2(N)
Hence, the Worst Case Time Complexity of Binary Search is: O(log N)*/

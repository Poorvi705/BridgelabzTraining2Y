/*The Best Case occurs when the target element is found at the first position of the array.
Target: 8 .Since 8 is the first element, Linear Search finds it after only one comparison.
Time Complexity: O(1)*/
/*The Worst Case occurs when the target element is at the last position or is not present in the array.
Target: 0
Array: {8, 61, 2, 3, 4, 0}
To find 0, Linear Search checks all 6 elements.Similarly, if the target is 5, which is not present, all elements must still be checked.
Time Complexity: O(n)*/
/*The Average Case occurs when the target is located at a random position in the array.
On average, Linear Search checks approximately half of the elements before finding the target.
For an array of n elements, the average number of comparisons is approximately:n / 2
